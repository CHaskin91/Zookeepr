# Zookeepr

## Lesson 1 
* Set up and run a Node.js web server using Express.js
* Handled two types of GET requests using parameters.
* Created a production-ready application and deployed it to Heroku.

## Lesson 2
* Used the Express.js app.post() method to create POST routes that accept incoming data from a client request.
* Implemented middleware functionality provided by Express.js to turn our incoming POST data into JSON data.
* Used Insomnia to test our POST requests while we wait for the zoo's front-end designer to give us client-side code.
