# Zookeepr

## Lesson 1 
* Set up and run a Node.js web server using Express.js
* Handled two types of GET requests using parameters.
* Created a production-ready application and deployed it to Heroku.

## Lesson 2
* Used the Express.js app.post() method to create POST routes that accept incoming data from a client request.
* Implemented middleware functionality provided by Express.js to turn our incoming POST data into JSON data.
* Used Insomnia to test our POST requests while we wait for the zoo's front-end designer to give us client-side code.

## Lesson 3
* Created GET routes that serve a front-end application to the client instead of just JSON data.
* Used middleware so that front-end routes can serve assets from the public folder and don't have to be in line with our HTML code.
* Used the Fetch API to create front-end POST functionality.
* Revisited our knowledge in front-end GET functionality for each pagesâ€™ forms.

## Lesson 4
* Break out animal functions into their own files in a lib/ directory.
* Use express.Router() instead of app.
* Create new endpoints and data for zookeepers.
